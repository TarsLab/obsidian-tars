# MCP Server Integration - Specification Summary

**Feature**: 001-integrate-mcp-servers  
**Branch**: `001-integrate-mcp-servers`  
**Status**: Draft (Pending Clarifications)  
**Created**: 2025-10-01

## Overview

This feature adds Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration to the Tars Obsidian plugin, enabling AI assistants to access external tools and data sources. Users can register MCP servers through settings, invoke tools via special markdown code blocks, and allow AI assistants to autonomously request tool execution.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. MCP Server Management
- Register multiple MCP servers via minimalistic settings UI
- Enable/disable servers without removing configuration
- Test connectivity and view connection status
- Persist configurations across sessions

### 2. User-Initiated Tool Execution
- Use code blocks with server name as language identifier:
  ```servername
  tool: tool_name
  param1: value1
  param2: value2
  ```
- Plugin executes tool and displays results in document
- Visual status indicators (pending, success, error)

### 3. AI-Initiated Tool Execution
- AI assistants can autonomously request MCP tool execution
- Tools exposed to AI as part of conversation context
- Results injected into AI context before response generation
- Transparent logging of all AI tool requests

### 4. Document Section Association
- Associate specific sections with designated MCP servers
- Section-based tool execution restrictions
- Inheritance from parent sections

## Requirements Summary

- **35 Functional Requirements** across 6 categories:
  - MCP Server Management (5 requirements)
  - Code Block Tool Invocation (6 requirements)
  - Document Section Association (4 requirements)
  - LLM-Initiated Tool Execution (5 requirements)
  - Error Handling & User Feedback (5 requirements)
  - Settings UI Requirements (5 requirements)
  - Security & Performance (5 requirements - needs clarification)

- **6 Acceptance Scenarios** with Given/When/Then format
- **10 Edge Cases** identified for testing
- **5 Key Entities** defined with relationships

## Clarifications Needed

Before proceeding to planning phase, the following must be resolved:

1. **FR-031**: Timeout duration for tool execution (5s, 30s, configurable?)
2. **FR-032**: Maximum concurrent tool executions (per document, per server, global?)
3. **FR-033**: Authentication mechanism for MCP servers (API keys, OAuth, certificates, none?)
4. **FR-034**: Tool execution sandboxing (restrictions on tool access?)
5. **FR-035**: Caching strategy for tool results (per session, persistent, configurable TTL?)

## Architectural Considerations

### Integration Points
- **Settings System**: Extend `PluginSettings` with MCP server configurations
- **Editor System**: Code block parsing and result rendering
- **Provider System**: Inject tool context into AI message flow
- **Commands**: Potential commands for manual tool execution/refresh

### External Dependencies
- MCP server infrastructure (Docker-hosted, user-managed)
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk package (already in node_modules)
- Container orchestration for MCP server lifecycle

### Design Constraints
- MCP servers hosted externally (not embedded in plugin)
- Asynchronous tool execution (may introduce latency)
- Results must be text-based or text-serializable
- Must respect Obsidian plugin architecture patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Gather clarifications for FR-031 to FR-035
2. **Planning**: Run `/plan` workflow to generate implementation plan
3. **Technical Research**: 
   - MCP protocol communication patterns
   - Docker networking from Electron/Obsidian
   - Code block processor implementation strategies
   - Tool context injection into provider message formats

## Compliance Notes

### Constitution Alignment
- ✅ **Test-Driven Development**: Specification is test-focused (10 edge cases, 6 scenarios)
- ✅ **Plugin Architecture**: Respects modular structure (settings, providers, editor)
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Key entities defined for TypeScript interface design
- ✅ **Upstream Compatibility**: Extends existing patterns without breaking changes
- ⚠️ **Clarifications Required**: Security/performance parameters need definition

### Template Compliance
- ✅ Mandatory sections completed
- ✅ Given/When/Then format used consistently
- ✅ Business value clearly articulated
- ✅ No implementation details in requirements
- ⚠️ 5 requirements marked [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] per template guidance

## Estimated Complexity

- **High**: Novel integration pattern for Obsidian plugins
- **High**: Real-time tool execution with AI flow integration
- **Medium**: Settings UI (minimalistic, standard patterns)
- **Medium**: Code block parsing and rendering
- **High**: Error handling and edge case coverage

**Recommendation**: Iterative development with MVP focusing on core tool execution, followed by AI integration and advanced features (section association, caching).
