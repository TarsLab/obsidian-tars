# MCP Architecture Cleanup - October 2025

## Summary

Successfully removed **~877+ lines of dead code** from the old MCP implementation approach.

## What Was Removed

### Source Files (4 files)
1. **`src/mcp/manager.ts`** (270 lines)
   - Old manager with custom Docker container lifecycle management
   - Used custom Docker API client and manual MCP SDK integration
   
2. **`src/mcp/docker.ts`** (270 lines)
   - Custom Docker Engine API client
   - HTTP wrapper for Docker socket communication
   - Container creation, lifecycle, and health checking

3. **`src/mcp/client.ts`** (197 lines)
   - Custom MCP client using `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` directly
   - Manual transport layer management (stdio/SSE)
   - Low-level protocol handling

4. **`src/mcp/healthMonitor.ts`** (~140 lines)
   - Health monitoring and retry logic for old manager
   - Docker container status checking

### Test Files (5 files)
1. `tests/mcp/manager.test.ts` - Contract tests for old manager
2. `tests/mcp/client-stdio.test.ts` - Stdio transport tests
3. `tests/mcp/client-sse.test.ts` - SSE transport tests
4. `tests/mcp/docker.test.ts` - Docker API client tests
5. `tests/mcp/healthMonitor.test.ts` - Health monitor tests

### Export Updates
Cleaned up `src/mcp/index.ts`:
- Removed: `export { MCPClientImpl }`
- Removed: `export { DockerClient }`
- Removed: `export { HealthMonitor }`

## Current Architecture

**Active Implementation:**
- **`src/mcp/managerMCPUse.ts`** - Uses `mcp-use` library for all MCP operations
- **Dependencies:**
  - `mcp-use` (v0.1.0) - High-level MCP client/server management
  - `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (v1.18.2) - Used internally by mcp-use

**Benefits:**
- Simpler codebase with fewer moving parts
- Library handles transport layer complexities
- Less maintenance burden
- Better tested (library is maintained by MCP community)

## Verification

✅ **Build:** `npm run build` - Success  
✅ **Tests:** `npm test` - All 83 tests pass (11 test files)  
✅ **No References:** Verified no imports remain to deleted files

## Migration Rationale

The project initially implemented a custom MCP integration with:
- Manual Docker API interaction
- Direct MCP SDK usage with custom transport management
- Custom health monitoring and retry logic

This was replaced with `mcp-use` library which provides:
- Abstracted server process management
- Built-in transport handling
- Session management
- Cleaner API surface

The old code remained in the codebase but was never cleaned up - until now.
